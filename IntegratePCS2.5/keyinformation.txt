I used to run the LDAP script from the ofmd1 boxes.
You can run the same from ofmd1.

You can login on ofmd1 with user: xroads , password: xroads

Go to the directory /crossroads/cgi-bin

If you run this command when in the directory /crossroads/cgi-bin

./addLDIF abc.ldif -e abc.rejects 

Where abc.ldif is the file having the ldif commands.

This will run the ldif contents against the 6.xx DEV LDAP.

To backout the changes you will have to run the backout file.
You will have to make this file executable and place it in the /crossroads/cgi-bin directory and just run the file to backout the changes.

I agree, alphabetically makes more sense even though not all menus follow that.

Implied permission 总是 PRSNTTN_ORDER 0000；而且，它们永远都不会出现在 界面 上

Menu item的 rsrc_typ_cd是4 (presentationgroup)。
也就是说，根本就不存在 presentation 这种resourceTypeCode
虽然存在着：3 permissiongroup 和 2 permission

There is only one Alert menu item, Alert View and Update control the same Alert menu.

If that is the case then that is not covered in the code.. as the menu item will still be displayed by the View Perm.

@Marvin : As Alex mentioned, the Alert Pod menu item to be shown when either of the Alert Pod View or Alert Pod Update permission is assigned.
You will have to define an implied permission and will have to imply that permission to the Alert Pod View and Alert Pod Update permission.
The menu item now will be based on this new implied permission.
