Implied permission 总是 PRSNTTN_ORDER 0000；而且，它们永远都不会出现在 界面 上

Menu item的 rsrc_typ_cd是4 (presentationgroup)。
也就是说，根本就不存在 presentation 这种resourceTypeCode
虽然存在着：3 permissiongroup 和 2 permission

There is only one Alert menu item, Alert View and Update control the same Alert menu.

If that is the case then that is not covered in the code.. as the menu item will still be displayed by the View Perm.

@Marvin : As Alex mentioned, the Alert Pod menu item to be shown when either of the Alert Pod View or Alert Pod Update permission is assigned.
You will have to define an implied permission and will have to imply that permission to the Alert Pod View and Alert Pod Update permission.
The menu item now will be based on this new implied permission.
